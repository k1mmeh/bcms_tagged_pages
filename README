Version 0.1

I welcome all feedback and suggestions regarding functionality, working or not.  Or
suggestions of how it could work better.

This module extends the core BrowserCMS Page type, to support tagging of pages.  This
is specifically for the purpose of creating a tags index (tags_with_pages portlet) and
then browse pages by tag (tagged_pages portlet).
It provides two new portlets, TagsWithPagesPortlet, which borrows much functionality
from the core TagCloudPortlet, but builds the could specifically from tags attached to
pages.  Also TaggedPagesPorlet, which provides a route to list Pages for a specific
tag.

To install, download the source from github at http://github.com/k1mmeh/bcms_tagged_pages.
Then inside the root directory of the downloaded source, run:
  gem build bcms_tagged_pages.gemspec

Then install the gem by running:
  gem install bcms_tagged_pages-0.1.gem

Now edit config/environment.rb and add the following line AFTER the inclusion of the
browsercms gem:
  config.gem 'bcms_tagged_pages', :version => '0.1'

Then to install the files appropriately, run:
  ruby script/generate browser_cms

Finally update the datebase by running the new migration.  Run:
  rake db:migrate

Once the module is installed, you can add the TagsWithPagesPortlet to any 
container in the site.  I recommend putting in a footer container, or in
a column navigation bar.

To list Pages with a given Tag, you need to update the page created by the
migration with is in the Home section and is called Pages by Tag.  Add the
TaggedPagesPortlet to the main container on this page.
